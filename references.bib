@article{bisgaard2019getting,
 abstract = {Scholars often evaluate citizens' democratic competence by focusing on their ability to get relevant facts right. In

this article, I show why this approach can yield misleading conclusions about citizen competence. I argue that although

citizens with strong partisan loyalties might be forced to accept the same facts, they find alternative ways to rationalize

reality. One such way, I show, is through the selective attribution of credit and blame. With four randomized experiments,

conducted in diverse national settings and containing closed- as well as open-ended questions, I find that as partisans

correctly updated economic beliefs to reflect new facts, they conversely attributed responsibility in a highly selective fashion.

Although partisans might acknowledge the same facts, they are apt in seizing on and producing attributional arguments

that fit their preferred worldviews.},

@article{brady2017emotion,
 abstract = {Political debate concerning moralized issues is increasingly common in online social networks. However, moral psychology has yet to incorporate the study of social networks to investigate processes by which some moral ideas spread more rapidly or broadly than others. Here, we show that the expression of moral emotion is key for the spread of moral and political ideas in online social networks, a process we call {\textquotedbl}moral contagion.{\textquotedbl} Using a large sample of social media communications about three polarizing moral/political issues (n = 563,312), we observed that the presence of moral-emotional words in messages increased their diffusion by a factor of 20{\%} for each additional word. Furthermore, we found that moral contagion was bounded by group membership; moral-emotional language increased diffusion more strongly within liberal and conservative networks, and less between them. Our results highlight the importance of emotion in the social transmission of moral ideas and also demonstrate the utility of social network methods for studying morality. These findings offer insights into how people are exposed to moral and political ideas through social networks, thus expanding models of social influence and group polarization as people become increasingly immersed in social media networks.},

@article{cacioppo1997beyond,
 abstract = {All organisms must be capable of differentiating hostile from hospitable stimuli to survive. Typically, this evaluative discrimination is conceptualized as being bipolar (hostile-hospitable). This conceptualization is certainly evident in the area of attitudes, where the ubiquitous bipolar attitude measure, by gauging the net affective predisposition toward a stimulus, treats positive and negative evaluative processes as equivalent, reciprocally activated, and interchangeable. Contrary to conceptualizations of this evaluative process as bipolar, recent evidence suggests that distinguishable motivational systems underlie assessments of the positive and negative significance of a stimulus. Thus, a stimulus may vary in terms of the strength of positive evaluative activation and the strength of negative evaluative activation it evokes. Low activation of positive and negative evaluative processes by a stimulus reflects attitude neutrality or indifference, whereas high activation of positive and negative evaluative processes reflects attitude ambivalence. As such, attitudes can be represented more completely within a bivariate space than along a bipolar continuum. Evidence is reviewed showing that the positive and negative evaluative processes underlying many attitudes are distinguishable (stochastically and functionally independent), are characterized by distinct activation functions (positivity offset and negativity bias principles), are related differentially to attitude ambivalence (corollary of ambivalence asymmetries), have distinguishable antecedents (heteroscedacity principle), and tend to gravitate from a bivariate toward a bipolar structure when the underlying beliefs are the target of deliberation or a guide for behavior (principle of motivational certainty). The implications for society phenomena such as political elections and democratic structures are discussed.},

Unexpectedly, two-sided messages, which repeat the inaccuracy before correcting

strategies that could help promote greater responsiveness to corrective messages.},

Using a survey experiment on climate change and genetically modified food (GMO) policy preferences in Germany and the United States (N = 3,000 total), we investigate how information provision shapes environmental policy attitudes and whether this effect is moderated by trust in science and trust in the source of messages. Findings show that information provision significantly shifted policy preferences towards the prevailing scientific opinion, but primarily among individuals whose prior attitudes conflicted with the scientific message. While trust in GMO science moderated message effectiveness in the U.S., generally the effects did not depend on levels of trust in science or trust in the message source. Results are similar for both countries, suggesting that the findings could be relevant to different political contexts.},

This article investigated the impact of emotionality of the material on people's ability to discount corrected misinformation. The focus was on moderate levels of emotionality comparable to those elicited by real-world news reports. Emotionality has frequently been shown to have an impact upon reasoning and memory, but the generality of this influence remains unclear. In three experiments, participants read a report of a fictitious plane crash that was initially associated with either an emotionally laden cause (terrorist attack) or an emotionally more neutral cause (bad weather). This initial attribution was followed by a retraction and presentation of an alternative cause (faulty fuel tank). The scenarios demonstrably affected participants' self-reported feelings. However, all three experiments showed that emotionality does not affect the continued influence of misinformation.},

@article{lewandowsky2012misinformation,
 abstract = {The widespread prevalence and persistence of misinformation in contemporary societies, such as the false belief that there

is a link between childhood vaccinations and autism, is a matter of public concern. For example, the myths surrounding

vaccinations, which prompted some parents to withhold immunization from their children, have led to a marked increase in

vaccine-preventable disease, as well as unnecessary public expenditure on research and public-information campaigns aimed at

rectifying the situation.

We first examine the mechanisms by which such misinformation is disseminated in society, both inadvertently and purposely.

Misinformation can originate from rumors but also from works of fiction, governments and politicians, and vested interests.

Moreover, changes in the media landscape, including the arrival of the Internet, have fundamentally influenced the ways in which

information is communicated and misinformation is spread.

We next move to misinformation at the level of the individual, and review the cognitive factors that often render

misinformation resistant to correction. We consider how people assess the truth of statements and what makes people believe

certain things but not others. We look at people's memory for misinformation and answer the questions of why retractions

of misinformation are so ineffective in memory updating and why efforts to retract misinformation can even backfire and,

ironically, increase misbelief. Though ideology and personal worldviews can be major obstacles for debiasing, there nonetheless

are a number of effective techniques for reducing the impact of misinformation, and we pay special attention to these factors

that aid in debiasing.

We conclude by providing specific recommendations for the debunking of misinformation. These recommendations pertain

to the ways in which corrections should be designed, structured, and applied in order to maximize their impact. Grounded

in cognitive psychological theory, these recommendations may help practitioners---including journalists, health professionals,

educators, and science communicators---design effective misinformation retractions, educational tools, and public-information

campaigns.},

populist leaders around the globe. In particular, we focus on specific emotional appraisals on elections held at

periods of heightened threat, including the two 2015 terror attacks in France, as influences on support for the

far-right Front National among conservatives. Contrary to much conventional wisdom, we speculate that threats

can generate both anger and fear, and with very different political consequences. We expect fear to inhibit

reliance on extant political dispositions such as ideological identification and authoritarianism, while anger

will strengthen the influence of these same dispositions. Our core findings, across repeated tests, show that fear

and anger indeed differentially condition the way habits of thought and action influence support for the far right

in the current historical moment. Contrary to conventional wisdom, it is anger that mobilizes the far right and

authoritarians. Fear, on the other hand, diminishes the impact of these same dispositions.},

Prior work on the psychology of misinformation has focused primarily on the extent to which reason and deliberation hinder versus help the formation of accurate beliefs. Several studies have suggested that people who engage in more reasoning are less likely to fall for fake news. However, the role of reliance on emotion in belief in fake news remains unclear. To shed light on this issue, we explored the relationship between experiencing specific emotions and believing fake news (Study 1; N = 409). We found that across a wide range of specific emotions, heightened emotionality at the outset of the study~was predictive of greater~belief in fake (but not real) news~posts. Then, in Study 2, we measured and manipulated reliance on emotion versus reason across four experiments (total N = 3884). We found both correlational and causal evidence that reliance on emotion increases belief in fake news: self-reported use of emotion was positively associated with belief in fake (but not real) news, and inducing reliance on emotion resulted in greater belief in fake (but not real) news stories compared to a control or to inducing reliance on reason. These results shed light on the unique role that emotional processing may play in susceptibility to fake news.},

We then discuss our own proposal, which is to abandon statistical significance. We recommend dropping the NHST paradigm?and the p-value thresholds intrinsic to it?as the default statistical paradigm for research, publication, and discovery in the biomedical and social sciences. Specifically, we propose that the p-value be demoted from its threshold screening role and instead, treated continuously, be considered along with currently subordinate factors (e.g., related prior evidence, plausibility of mechanism, study design and data quality, real world costs and benefits, novelty of finding, and other factors that vary by research domain) as just one among many pieces of evidence. We have no desire to ?ban? p-values or other purely statistical measures. Rather, we believe that such measures should not be thresholded and that, thresholded or not, they should not take priority over the currently subordinate factors. We also argue that it seldom makes sense to calibrate evidence as a function of p-values or other purely statistical measures. We offer recommendations for how our proposal can be implemented in the scientific publication process as well as in statistical decision making more broadly.},

This leads to a reduction in the use of insecticides in water and on land. If anything, the GMO varieties are safer than traditionally bred varieties because they are made in a very precise manner. However, the scientific evidence on this issue is being ignored by the Green Parties such as Greenpeace who continue to deny the science and mislead the public. 129 Nobel Laureates have joined in a campaign to convince the Green Parties and the public that they should support the use of GMOs, especially for the sake of the developing world.},

@article{ryan2019actions,
 abstract = {A striking characteristic of moral judgments is that people commonly assign value to particular actions, irrespective of

what consequences the actions bring about. This phenomenon might be important to understanding political judgments,

when people frequently purport to stand on principle, even when doing so comes at a substantial cost. Here, I draw on

work in psychology that might help identify which citizens are insensitive to consequences in the context of political

argumentation. I find that a particular facet of attitude intensity (moral conviction) identifies citizens who think about

political issues in absolutist terms (studies 1 and 2) and who dismiss damaging information about policy consequences

(studies 3 and 4). These results develop understanding of what attributesmake different political arguments compelling to

different people and illustrate the utility of attitude intensity measures as a way to account for the atomized and disorganized

nature of political opinions.},

In Study 1, participants learned associations between Chinese ideographs and their English meanings that were either positively or negatively valenced; subsequently, they were informed that these meanings were incorrect. Despite this cognitive invalidation, the affect associated with the ideographs persevered. Studies 2 and 3 ruled out alternative explanations. Study 4 showed that invalidating information containing opposite affective valence succeeded in changing the affective perseverance, whereas the neutral cognitive invalidation of Studies 1 through 3 did not. The present research provides an empirical demonstration of affective perseverance, specifying the conditions where affective preferences do and do not persevere when confronted with invalidating information. Discussion centers on issues of underlying mechanism and implications for other psychological phenomena.},

 abstract = {Novel food technologies are important for food security, safety and sustainability. Consumers, however, are often hesitant to accept them. In this narrative Review, we organize the research describing how heuristics and individual differences among consumers influence the acceptance of agri-food technologies. Associations evoked by a food technology, its perceived naturalness and trust in the industry using it influence consumer acceptance. Food neophobia, disgust sensitivity and cultural values are crucial personality factors for explaining individual differences. Using gene technology, nanotechnology, cultured meat and food irradiation as cases, we explore factors that may explain consumers' acceptance or lack of acceptance. Climate change, food supply shocks caused by crises such as pandemics and population growth are imminent threats to the food system. Therefore, disruptive food technologies will be needed to progress towards a more resilient food system. Taking into account the factors influencing consumers' perceptions of novel food technologies during the early stage of development and introduction will hopefully result in a higher acceptance of such technologies.},

and consequences of attitudes that are experienced as moral convictions, that

is, attitudes that people perceive as grounded in a fundamental distinction

psychologically distinct from other constructs (e.g., strong but nonmoral attitudes

or religious beliefs), are perceived as universally and objectively true,

and are comparatively immune to authority or peer influence. Variance in

moral conviction also predicts important social and political consequences.

Stronger moral conviction about a given attitude object, for example, is associated

with greater intolerance of attitude dissimilarity, resistance to procedural

solutions for conflict about that issue, and increased political engagement

and volunteerism in that attitude domain. Finally, we review recent

research that explores the processes that lead to attitude moralization; we

integrate these efforts and conclude with a new domain theory of attitude

moralization.},

The current study investigated whether participants reduce their support of Republican and Democratic politicians when the prevalence of

from political candidates or (2) disproportionately more false than factual statements. Participants received fact-checks as to whether items were true or false, then rerated both their belief in the statements as well as their

feelings towards the candidate. Results indicated that when corrected misinformation was presented alongside equal presentations of affirmed factual statements, participants reduced their belief in the misinformation but did not reduce their feelings towards the politician. However, if there was considerably more misinformation retracted than factual statements affirmed, feelings towards both Republican and Democratic figures were reduced---although the observed effect size was extremely small.},

We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98{\%} agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.},

Fact-checking has a significantly positive overall influence on political beliefs (d =~0.29), but the effects gradually weaken when using ?truth scales,? refuting only parts of a claim, and fact-checking campaign-related statements. Likewise, the ability to correct political misinformation with fact-checking is substantially attenuated by participants? preexisting beliefs, ideology, and knowledge.
