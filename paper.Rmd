abstract: \setstretch{1} \noindent Concerns about various forms of misinformation and its fast dissemination through online media have generated huge interest into ways to effectively correct false claims. An under-explored mechanism in this research is the role of distinct emotions. How do emotional appeals interact with corrective information? Specifically, I focus on the emotion of disgust, which has been shown to be linked to the moralization of attitudes, which in turn reduces the impact of empirical evidence on attitudes and makes compromise less likely. Substantively, I investigate the issue of genetically modified (GM) food. I implement a pre-registered survey experiment manipulating both misinformation and corrective information treatments within a panel study based on a probability sample of the general population in Germany. Results show, first, that an emotionally framed piece of misinformation can increase moralization, replicating previous findings. Second, a neutral correction to the misinformation is only effective if the misnformation does not include a strong emotional frame, whereas a correction embedded in a counterframe is effective for both low and high emotional misinformation. In a broader perspective, these results inform further studies and policy interventions on other issues where disinformation loads on strong emotions, ranging from social policy over immigration to health interventions such as vaccinations. \vspace{.8cm}
# abstract-template: Everyone agrees that this issue is really important. But we do not know much about this specific question, although it matters a great deal, for these reasons. We approach the problem from this perspective. Our research design focuses on these cases and relies on these data, which we analyze using this method. Results show what we have learned about the question. They have these broader implications.

# Introduction
<!-- Guiding Question about people, not scholars! -->
How do emotional appeals interact with corrective information?
<!-- context on misinformation and the important role of emotions in spreading it -->
Fueled by the fast dissemination through digital media, the issue of various forms of misinformation has become a major concern both in academia and for public policy [@jerit2020political; @lazer2018science; @lewandowsky2012misinformation; @wardle2017information].
To limit the danger from inaccurate or misleading information, efforts of fact-checking or corrective information more generally are widely applied [@walter2020fact]. A common finding in the maturing literature on corrective information is that these interventions are usually successful in reducing misperceptions, but may not translate to other outcomes such as attitudes, candidate evaluations or blame attribution [@bisgaard2019getting; @nyhan2019taking; @swire2019they; @thorson2016belief].

<!-- % still, we know little about the role of discrete emotions in interacting with misinformation and corrective information -->

While this has been linked to affect [@thorson2016belief], the connection of distinct emotions to both susceptibility to misinformation, and the effectiveness of corrective information is under-explored. This is unfortunate given the important role that emotional appeals play in the dissemination of false or misleading information. We know that false news spread faster than true news, possibly because they are more likely to evoke emotions of surprise and disgust [@vosoughi2018spread]. In general, moral-emotional language is rewarded on social media [@brady2017emotion].


<!-- % emotion in political science -->
In this study, I follow recent work in political science inspired by moral psychology. Most relevant for this study, @clifford2019emotional finds that a persuasive emotional frame loading on emotions of anger and disgust increases the perception of an issue as being one of moral conviction [@skitka2020psychology; @wisneski2017moralization]. While it is often seen as a binary categorization whether or not an issue is a moral one, there is quite some variation in the extent of moralization within issues [@ryan2014reconsidering] with distinct behavioral consequences, such as an absolute unwillingness to compromise [@ryan2017no] or a tendency to view that issue in absolutist term and to be less likely to be open for information about consequences [@ryan2019actions]. 
<!-- Moral conviction, i.e. the conviction that the handling of an issue touches morality and is about fundamental right or wrong, can be seen as a dimension of attitude strength [@skitka2018attitude].  -->
<!-- % get more concrete linking belief echoes / affective perseverance and specific emotion with possible connection to moralization -->
<!-- In his study, @clifford2019emotional shows that disgust-evoking messages can increase moral conviction with its consequences on polarizing attitudes. However, some of the treatment material used in his study comes from a later retracted study linking GMO and cancer. Such a piece of information can be classified as misinformation in the sense of going against "best available evidence in the public sphere"[@flynn2017nature, p.128]. -->


<!-- % Contribution bringing belief echoes and discrete emotions together -->
In the context of misinformation, it seems possible and worrisome that such an increase in moral conviction through emotional framing may also take place through a piece of factually incorrect information. If this is the case, how does the evoked information interfere with subsequent efforts to correct the misinformation? Do emotions evoked by a piece of misinformation make effective corrections less likely? And do such misinformation induced emotions and related attitudes persist despite successful correction?
<!-- From findings of belief echoes [@thorson2016belief] and affective perseverance [@sherman2002affective] we can further suspect that such emotional effects of frames may persist even in the face of successful factual correction. -->
<!-- This study contributes to the literature of corrective information by linking the concept of belief echoes to the perseverance of specific emotions with related consequences on attitudes.  -->
Substantively, I provide evidence on the effect of emotionally charged misinformation on perceptions of GM food, and ways to effectively correct false claims.

Results show, first, that an emotionally framed piece of misinformation can increase moralization, replicating previous findings. Second, a neutral correction to the misinformation is only effective if the misnformation does not include a strong emotional frame, whereas a correction embedded in a counterframe is effective for both low and high emotional misinformation.
<!-- % Final Punchline on broader relevance -->
<!-- In the view of many scientists [@roberts2018nobel, @planck2019scientists], genetic engineering provides avenues with large potential benefits, which may be impeded by public resistance possibly originating from misleading claims easily disseminated through online media. -->
In a broader perspective, these results inform further studies and policy interventions on other issues where disinformation loads on strong emotions, ranging from social policy over immigration to health interventions such as vaccinations.



# Theory

## Misinformation and corrective information {-}

Recent times have seen growing concerns about political misinformation in various forms such as "fake news" or the so called "infodemic" of science misinformation around the COVID-19 pandemic [@jerit2020political; @lazer2018science; @scheufele2021misinformation]. Misinformed individuals hold misperceptions, i.e. "factual beliefs that are false or contradict the best available evidence in the public domain" [@flynn2017nature, p. 128]. Wide-spread belief in misinformation biases collective public opinion and thus poses a threat for democratic outcomes [@kuklinski2000misinformation]. 
<!-- This concern is now more prevalent than ever. We live in a complex world and the digital era has made available an abundance of information at a glance. While this gives huge opportunities, concerns about "fake news" and its dissemination through digital technologies and social media are rampant [@allcott2017social; lazer2018science].  -->
Misperceptions can be due to both disinformation (false or misleading information disseminated with the intent to deceive) or misinformation (false information that may be disseminated with good intentions) [@southwell2018misinformation], as well as the flawed interpretation of accurate information, e.g. through cognitive biases [@lau2001advantages]. 

<!-- * People may resist corrective information due to directional motivated reasoning, sometimes even leading to "backfire" effects [@nyhan2010corrections] where misperceptions are more strongly held after correction, but most of the time corrections are at least partially successful [@walter2020fact; @wood2019elusive]. -->

Because these misperceptions exist, both public and scholarly interest has been directed heavily to the question of how to correct them [@ec2018tackling; @lewandowsky2012misinformation; @walter2018unring}.
Some studies find that directional motivation not only leads individuals to disregard corrective information, but produces a "backfire" effect where the incorrect prior belief is even strengthened despite having been corrected [@hart2012boomerang; @nyhan2010corrections].
While being worrisome, this effect is rare. Predispositions such as ideology do affect the way corrective information is processed, but research also shows that corrections by and large work in the expected direction [@guess2018does; @wood2019elusive]. 
A quickly growing number of studies accumulates evidence on the effects of corrective information and fact-checking in various contexts [@walter2018unring; @walter2019fact].


* However, while corrective information usually moves factual beliefs in the appropriate direction, the effects on other outcomes such as attitudes, blame attributions, or evaluations are mixed [@bisgaard2019getting; @nyhan2019taking; @swire2019they]
* Especially troubling cases are "affective perseverance" [@sherman2002affective], and "belief echoes", where effects of misinformation on attitudes persist despite successful correction of the factual belief [@thorson2016belief].
* Although we know that emotions may contribute to the spread of false information [@vosoughi2018spread], there is little evidence on the role of emotions for misinformation and corrective information (exceptions include [@ecker2011terrorists; @martel2020reliance; @rosenzweig2021happiness; @weeks2015emotions]).


## Emotional framing and moralization {-}

*t.b.d.*

* Emotional framing is an important feature of political communication, and theories such as cognitive appraisal theory [@moors2013appraisal] or affective intelligence theory [@marcus2000affective; @marcus2019applying] provide frameworks for empirical expectaitoins about specific emotions.
* Findings from moral psychology on moralization through disgust [@clifford2019emotional; @wisneski2017moralization].
* Importance of moral conviction for compromise, openness to scientific findings on consequences versus absolutist opposition [@ryan2014reconsidering; @ryan2017no; @ryan2019actions].
* Of course, people are free to have moral convictions about any issue, but if emotional frames can induce moral conviction, we might have to worry about emotionally framed **mis**information also inducing moral conviction.

<!-- Although there is a rich literature on emotions in politics shedding light on its effect on information processing, political learning and participation, the connection of distinct emotions to both susceptibility to misinformation and the effectiveness of corrective information is under-explored. -->


<!-- % From Vasiloupolou / Wagner -->
<!-- %Early research into emotional reactions either used one simple positive–negative dimension or a two-dimensional valence model (Marcus, 2003; Marcus et al., 2000). More recently, researchers have argued that distinct emotions may characterise individuals’ reactions (e.g. Huddy et al., 2007; Larsen and McGraw, 2011; Petersen, 2010; Smith et al., 2008; Valentino et al., 2008, 2011; Weber, 2012; see also Conover and Feldman, 1986). Appraisal theories of emotions suggest that various distinct emotions arise due to individuals’ cognitive interpretation of the situation they experience (e.g. Roseman, 1991; Smith and Ellsworth, 1985; for a review, see Brader and Marcus, 2013). Neuroscientific theories based on the neural processes that generate emotional responses have also increasingly turned towards a three-dimensional model of emotions that distinguishes between fear, anger and enthusiasm (Brader and Marcus, 2013; Lerner and Keltner, 2001). Research in political psychology building on both appraisal and neural process theories has therefore focused in particular on the causes and consequences of anger, fear1 and enthusiasm as distinct emotions (Carver and Harmon-Jones, 2009; Conover and Feldman, 1986; Huddy et al., 2005, 2007; Lerner and Keltner, 2000, 2001; Petersen, 2010; Smith and Ellsworth, 1985; Valentino et al., 2011). -->
<!-- % -->
<!-- %Applied to political phenomena, distinct emotions cause different types of actions and attitudes: fear leads to caution and openness, and anger to more confident and aggressive responses (Druckman and McDermott, 2008; MacKuen et al., 2010). For instance, whereas fear and anger both tend to increase intolerance and threat perceptions (e.g. Erişen and Kentmen-Cin, 2017), they lead to distinct ways of reacting to terrorist threats (Lerner et al., 2003). Fearful citizens are more wary of the increased risk and turn to isolationism, while angry citizens are less risk-averse and tend to favour pro-active intervention (Huddy et al., 2007). Anxious citizens are also more likely to seek out new information and process this carefully (Brader et al., 2008; Marcus et al., 2000; Merolla and Zechmeister, 2009; Valentino et al., 2008). Finally, enthusiasm increases the willingness to participate in politics, but like anger it also increases less careful forms of information-processing (Brader, 2006; Marcus et al., 2000). -->

## Empirical expectations {-}

From findings on moral conviction and how emotional frames induce it [@clifford2019emotional; @wisneski2017moralization], I expect that a persuasive piece of misinformation evoking negative emotions, notably disgust and anger, can increase perceptions of the respective issue as being one of moral conviction. In order to count as a persuasive message, I expect the message to affect both factual beliefs and policy opinions in its direction.

* H1 A persuasive, emotionally framed misinformation evoking negative emotions of disgust and anger makes individuals more likely to favor policy restrictions on the respective issue and to perceive the issue as one of moral conviction.


<!-- % Moderation -->

<!-- % possible theoretical contribution by categorizing different emotion effects -->
<!-- %To categorize effects of emotions within the context mis- and corrective information, there are two general ways in which emotions may affect its effectiveness. In both cases, one can further differentiate between cases where the emotion is invoked by, or at least closely tied to, the object that is part of the information (integral emotion), and cases where the emotion is induced irrespective of the piece of information (incidental emotion, often also referred to as mood). Emotion as moderator. emotions affect information processing so also for misinformation and corrective information. But anxiety, anger and disgust word in different directions... emotion within fake news, see Martel. Emotion as outcome -->

Concerning the impact of corrective information, I expect that it will be effective in reducing factual misperceptions, irrespective of the presence of evoked emotions. This is in line with previous research showing no moderation effect on corrections due to emotional framing  [@ecker2011terrorists].

* H2a Corrective information is effective in eliminating the misinformation effect on factual beliefs, irrespective of the emotional framing of the misinformation.


<!-- % Belief echoes and affective perseverance -->

However, similar to previous results on affective perseverance [@sherman2002affective] and belief echoes [@thorson2016belief], I expect the effects of emotionally framed misinformation on policy opinion, moral conviction, and emotions to persist even in the face of effective factual correction.


* H2b The emotionally framed misinformation leaves an impact on policy opinions, moral conviction, and emotions.


Together, hypotheses 2a and 2b represent the existence of a "belief echo", i.e. the continued effect of a piece of misinformation on attitudinal or emotional outcomes, despite successful factual correction. If only H2a is supported, the correction is altogether successful. If H2a is not supported, the correction is either completely ineffective or its effectiveness is moderated by the emotional framing of the misinformation.

<!-- % Counter-framing -->

Corrective information such as fact-checking is usually deliberately presented in a rather neutral way. In the case of strongly emotional framed misinformation, such a neutral correction may thus be successful in correcting factual beliefs, but not be able to counter the emotional impact of the misinformation. If this is the case, a more effective strategy may be to counter the emotional misinformation not with a neutral correction but with a correction embedded in an emotional counter-frame. If equally persuasive, such counterframes have been shown to negate the effect of an original frame [@chong2007competitive; @chong2013counterframing]. I expect a similar effect to hold in response to emotionally framed misinformation.

* H3 A correction embedded in a persuasive emotional counterframe eliminates the misinformation effect on policy opinions, moral conviction, and emotions.

## GM food - a case for emotional reactions and misinformation {-}

<!-- % explain the relevance of GMO as an issue, also in relation to moralization -->
The topic of GM food is particularly suited for this study because it is an issue where science and public opinion diverge considerably, implying a relevant role for corrective information [@diamond2020does; @hasell2020differential; @carnahan2019processing]. This is especially true within the German population, which is where this study draws its sample from [@gaskell2010europeans]. GM food is also a topic on which there are misperceptions, possibly due to disinformation. Of course, there is legitimate criticism on the use of genetic modification. However, studies show that extreme opponents of GM food know the least about it [@fernbach2019extreme], and a lack of acceptance of novel food technologies against scientific evidence can be seen as as a threat for the development of a more resilient food system [@siegrist2020consumer]. 

# Data & Methods

To investigate the direct effects of misinformation and corrective information conditional on emotional framing, I conducted a pre-registered survey experiment.^[The pre-registration can be found on OSF: https://osf.io/y63xu.] The experiment was implemented within wave 53 of the German Internet Panel (GIP) [@blom2015setting]. The GIP is a longitudinal panel survey based on a probability sample of the general population in Germany. Fieldwork for this study took place in May 2021 and the sample size reached 4,260 respondents.

The between-subjects survey experiment followed a 3 $\times$ 3 design varying both misinformation (none, low emotional framing, high emotional framing) and corrective information (none, neutral correction, counterframe correction). Respondents were randomly assigned to one of the nine resulting groups, thus yielding eight treatment conditions and one control condition were no information treatment was shown.

At the end of the survey, respondents received an extensive debriefing clarifying the sources of all information that was shown and on the intention of the experiment. Because all shown information has in a similar format been in the media^[www.welt.de/newsticker/news1/article109594074/Bundesinstitut-Genmais-Schaeden-nicht-ausreichend-belegt], there is no deception taking place. The study was approved by the team operating the GIP, with the goal of designing the study in a way that it is a pleasant experience for respondents.

## Treatment Material {-}

The experimental treatment consists of a combination of two types of information, each mimicking a short online news article. One type of information reports the results of a study claiming that genetically modified corn lead to increased cancer rates in rats, and features the headline *"GM corn-fed rats die earlier"*. The wording is partly taken from actual news coverage of the study in 2012, and partly from treatment material in @clifford2019emotional. The respective study has been retracted due to non-adherence to scientific procedures, and the current scientific evidence does not point to severe health problems associated with genetically modified animal feed [@brody2018are]. The information within the study can thus be classified as misinformation.^[This is consistent with a definition of resulting mis*perceptions* as "factual beliefs that are false or contradict the best available evidence in the public domain" [@flynn2017nature, p.128]. If one would presume the intent to mislead, this would then be classified as disinformation.] I vary this misinformation to be either low or high in emotional framing by ex- or including graphical images of a rat with a cancer tumor and rotten corn, images that are taken from @clifford2019emotional and shown to induce negative feelings, specifically disgust.

The second type of information reports the accurate scientific consensus that GM food is generally safe to eat, that a study showing cancer growth in rats due to GM feed has been retracted, and that genetically modifying plants for the food industry is not a new phenomenon. This piece of information is a correction to the misinformation in that it reflects best available scientific evidence and it is constructed to conform to best practice standards of debunking information [@lewandowsky2020debunking]. As a neutral correction, this piece of information corrects the misinformation about concrete health risks from GM food in a text-only format. The headline for the neutral correction reads *"Genetic engineering does not introduce novel risks"*. By negating the risks, it still stays within the overall framing of GM food as possibly risky, and does not add specific further information about benefits from GM food. This is done in a further condition, where the corrective information is embedded in a counterframe, emphasizing positive aspects of GM food, such as its potential to contribute to more sustainable agriculture by reducing pesticides, and its potential to fight malnutrition. Here, the headline reads *"Genetic research for a more sustainable agriculture"*. ^[Screenshots of the shown information treatments in the German original are included in the Appendix in figures \@ref(fig:screenshot-low-misinfo) to \@ref(fig:screenshot-counterframe).]

The misinformation (if any is assigned) is always shown first, immediately followed by the corrective information (if any is assigned). For respondents, the manipulation is thus designed in a way that both types of information "hits them between the eyes" [@kuklinski2000misinformation, p.805].

## Outcome measures {-}

To acknowledge findings from the maturing corrective information literature on varying correction success for different outcomes, I include a set of several measures.

As the factual belief of interest, I measure factual beliefs about the safety of GM foods by asking respondents whether they think that the statement that eating GM foods is safe for one's health is false or correct on a 7-point scale from "certainly false" to "certainly correct". To provide a broad measure of policy support, I use a measure by [@diamond2020does] that asks respondents how high a policy priority it should be to restrict the use of GM food on a 7-point scale from "no priority" to "highest priority". I measure moral conviction with two standard items from the literature, asking respondents whether their evaluation of GM food is connected to moral convictions and about fundamental right and wrong, respectively, on a 5-point scale from "not at all" to "very much" [@skitka2020psychology]. This is a direct measure of a "meta-cognition", building on the assumption that respondents know which issues are about moral conviction for them. Both items will be combined into a simple additive index.

Lastly, I measure distinct emotions by directly asking respondents how well a given feeling represents how they feel toward GM food. Asking about their feelings toward GM food makes this a measure of integral, not incidental emotion, in line with expectation about to which kind of emotion moralization responds [@skitka2018attitude]. The distinct negative emotions I measure are disgust, anger, anxiety, and sadness, each on a 5-point scale from "not at all" to "extremely".

```

## Descriptive statistics {-}

Table \@ref(tab:descriptives) shows descriptive statistics of the outcome variables in the control group, which does not get any informational treatment and thus serves as the reference to investigate information effects. On the scale from 0 to 4, anger as an emotional reaction to th issue of GM food was expressed with a mean of 1.7 moderately below the midpoint. Anxiety was above the midpoint with a mean of 2.4 whereas disgust was relatively low with a mean of 1.3, and sadness again moderately below the midpoint with 1.7. These figures indicate that respondents' negative reactions to GM food stem from concerns rather than disgust.

With regard to the factual belief that GM food is safe to eat, the sample is skewed toward the view that this is rather not true (mean = 3.2 on a scale from 1 to 7). When it comes to opinions about policy restrictions for GM food, respondents are rather in favor (mean = 5.2 on a scale from 1 to 7). Finally, the measure of moral conviction is close to the midpoint (mean = 4.4 on a scale from 0 to 8). These results indicate that the misperception that GM food is not safe for one own's health is wide-spread in Germany and that policy restrictions are largely favored, with moderate ties to moral conviction.

         "Moral conviction" = "moral_conviction") %>% 
  datasummary_skim(histogram =FALSE,
                   output = "default",
                   title = "Descriptive statistics in the control group")

```

## Moralization through misinformation {-}

I now turn to the effects of the informational treatments on the outcome variables. To quantify these effects, I run separate linear regressions with the respective outcome as the dependent variable and the treatment group indicator as the independent variable. For a more intuitive interpretation of the effect sizes - and to be able to compare outcome variables measured on different scales - I rescale all outcome variables to range from 0 to 1. I do not include any control variables because the random assignment of the experimental design provides the better safeguard against any possible confounders. 

In the appendix, I report the regression tables, in the following I will visualize the estimated regression coefficients for the different treatment conditions. Without any controls, the coefficients refer to the difference in the mean of the outcome between the control and the respective treatment group. ^[The significance of the coefficients is equivalent to running separate t-tests between the group means, which raises the issue of adjusting for multiple testing. There are different approaches from different traditions to that. When conducting many independent t-tests, it seems straight-forward to adjust for multiple testing, although the general advise to always adjust for multiple testing is not warranted [@althouse2016adjust]. Another approach is to conduct ANOVA, which is an omnibus test, with the null-hypothesis of no effect of the treatment conditions together versus the control. To check for individual differences between experimental groups, post-hoc tests can be conducted with respective appreciation of multiple testing adjustments. This is appropriate if one has no specific hypotheses to begin with. If one has these hypotheses, however, one can use ANOVA with planned contrasts (e.g. [@field2012discovering]), which is then again equivalent to the results of a regression with dummy variables coded according to the specified contrasts. When I use multiple outcomes in my pre-registered hypotheses, the expectation is not that any of the outcomes shows an effect (in which case adjustment for multiple testing should be done), but rather a joint pattern of effects.]

  row.names(df) <- NULL
  return(df)
}

First, \@ref(fig:misinfo-only) reports the effects of receiving only the misinformation message. The upper half of the figure shows two plots with the effects of the low emotion misinformation and the lower half shows two plots with the effects of the high emtoion misinformation message. The y-axis indicates the different outcome variables, and the x-axis indicates the effect size relative to the control group, which serves as the reference category for all models. 

In the top row of the lower right panel, we see the largest effect, which results from the high emotional frame on the factual belief outcome. Respondents receiving the high emotional misinformation about GM food agree to the statement that GM food is safe to eat with a score that is 16 percentage points less than the control group. For the low emotion misinformation, the effect is 13 percentage points, indicating that both messages are persuasive in bringing the average factual belief farther from the scientific consensus belief.

Concerning effects on emotions, policy opinion and moral conviction, results largely replicate results by @clifford2019emotional. The high emotional misinformation induces stronger emotions than the low emotion misinformation, especially for disgust. Both misinformation messages increase demand for restrictive policies, but only the high misinformation misinformation significantly increases moral conviction (by 6 percentage points). There is thus support for H1.

## Effectiveness of neutral correction {-}

After having established that a persuasive, emotionally framed message containing misinformation can influence policy opinion and increase moral conviction, I now report the results of the neutral correction in figure \@ref(fig:neutral-correction). The neutral correction is effective for the low emotion misinformation, but not the high emotion misinformation. The emotional frame of the misinformation therefore moderates the correcion effectiveness. Although weakened, the effects on policy opinion and moral conviction induced by the high emotion misinformation persist after the correction, confirming H2b. Even if the correction significantly moves the factual belief after the high emotion misinformation, there still persists an effect of the misinformation relative to the control group. The correction is therefore not successful in eradicating the misinformation effect, which rejects H2a. In sum, there is no belief echo, but a moderation of the correction effectiveness.

```

## Counterframe correction {-}

Finally, results from the counterframe message show that a correction embedded in a persuasive positive frame is successful in bringing all outcome measures to the control group level (see figure \@ref(fig:counterframe)). 
It should be noted, however, that there is also no positive effect of the positively framed message on beliefs and opinions towards GM food, although the counterframe message itself is persuasive (figure \@ref(fig:info-only) in the appendix). On average, the two competitive frames seem to cancel each other out. This points to a challenge for science communication within an information environment in which accurate information (even if persuasive) has to compete with inaccurate or misleading information.

```{r counterframe,  fig.align="center", fig.cap="Effects of the counterframe correction for misinformation with low and high emotional framing.

# Conclusion

*t.b.d.*

Summary: 

* Persuasive, emotionally framed misinformation can increase moralization of opinions about GM food, replicating findings from @clifford2019emotional.
* A neutral correction is successful for low emotional misinformation, but effects of highly emotional misinformation persist with neutral corrective information
* Providing a correction embedded in a positive counterframe message works for both low and high emotional misinformation.
* Overall small effects: Explained variance ($R^2$) of $7 \%$ for beliefs, $3.5 \%$ for opinions, $1 \%$ for moral conviction.

Limitations:

* No distinction between emotional framing and visual cues (see e.g. @hameleers2020picture).

Implications:

* When misinformation is emotionally charged, fact-checkers and science communicators may have to think about counterframes to eliminate the misinformation effect.
* Concerning GM food, it is argued that a lack of acceptance of novel food technologies against scientific evidence can be seen as as a threat for the development of a more resilient food system [@siegrist2020consumer]. With emotional misinformation in circulation, persuasive counterframes seem necessary to even equal out their effects.
* Similar effects seem likely on other issues where misinformation loads on strong emotions, e.g. health interventions such as vaccinations.
